# Valentine Website

Simple Valentine-themed web page with a cute character and interactive buttons.

## Deployment

This repository can be hosted with GitHub Pages:
1. Create a new GitHub repository named `Valentine` (or any name you prefer).
2. In your local project directory, run:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/Valentine.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```
3. In the GitHub repo settings, go to **Pages** and choose the `main` branch and `/ (root)` folder as the source.
4. Save and wait a few minutes; your site will be available at `https://<your-username>.github.io/Valentine/`.

Enjoy your hosted Valentine site! ❤️
